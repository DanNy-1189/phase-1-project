# Classic Video Games

## Introduction
Growing up, my siblings and I absolutely loved playing with our NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), Nintendo 64, Playstation, and more. I still love them and in fact, I either still own my old games and consoles or repurchased the ones our mother gave away. Replaying them with our mother recently is how I came up with the concept for this project. The games included in the project are some of my absolute favorites.

## Description
For my first project, I wanted to make it as close to a e-commerce app as I was possibly able to with my beginner knowledge of javascript along with extensive research. My product allows the user to use the search bar to narrow down their game search so they don't have to scroll amongst the complete list of games to find what they want. They can click on the 'magnify glass' button or press the 'enter' key. If the desired game isn't in the list, no games will show. The typed letters can be cleared with 'x' that shows in the search bar, and then press 'enter' or click the icon to return all the games.

Another feature of the product is adding games to the cart. Users can click the "Add To Cart" button within a game card to add that specific game to the cart.
