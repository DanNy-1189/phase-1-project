# Classic Video Games

## Introduction
Growing up, my siblings and I absolutely loved playing with our NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), Nintendo 64, Playstation, and more. I still love them and in fact, I either still own my old games and consoles or repurchased the ones our mother gave away. Replaying them with our mother recently is how I came up with the concept for this project. The games included in the project are some of my absolute favorites.

## Description
For my first project, I wanted to make it as close to a e-commerce app as I was possibly able to with my beginner knowledge of javascript along with extensive research. My product allows the user to use the search bar to narrow down their game search so they don't have to scroll amongst the complete list of games to find what they want. They can click on the 'magnify glass' button or press the 'enter' key. If the desired game isn't in the list, no games will show. The typed letters can be cleared with 'x' that shows in the search bar, and then press 'enter' or click the icon to return all the games.

Another feature of the product is adding games to the cart. Users can click the "Add To Cart" button within a game card to add that specific game to the cart.

The item is then added to the cart where the cart icon will display the number of items in the cart, and clicking on the cart will display the added games as well as the price total.

The user is also able to remove items from the cart, which in turn impacts the quantity and sum of the cart.

The final feature is the checkout aspect of the project. When the user clicks on the "Checkout" button when the cart has items, an alert will pop up thanking the user for their purchase and the quantity and sum of the cart will reset to "0" and "$0" respectively. If the user clicks on the "Checkout" button when there are no items in the cart, and an alert will pop up notifying the user that the cart is empty.
