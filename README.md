# Classic Video Games (Shopping Cart)

## Introduction
Growing up, my siblings and I loved playing with our NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and more. I still love them, and I either own my old games and consoles or repurchase the ones our mother gave away. Replaying them with our mother recently is how I developed the concept for this project. The games included in the project are some of my absolute favorites.

## Description
For my first project, I wanted to make it as close to an e-commerce app as possible with my beginner knowledge of javascript and extensive research. My product allows users to use the search bar to narrow their game search so they don't have to scroll amongst the complete list of games to find what they want. They can click the 'magnify glass' button or press the 'enter' key. No games will appear if the desired game isn't on the list. The typed letters can be cleared with the 'x' in the search bar, and then press 'enter' or click the icon to return all the games.

Another feature of the product is adding games to the cart. Users can click the "Add To Cart" button within a game card to add that specific game to the cart.

The item is then added to the cart, where the cart icon will display the number of items in the cart, and clicking on the cart will display the added games and the price total.

Users can also remove items from the cart, which impacts the cart's quantity and sum.

The final feature is the checkout aspect of the project. When the user clicks on the "Checkout" button when the cart has items, an alert will pop up thanking the user for their purchase, and the quantity and sum of the cart will reset to "0" and "$0," respectively. If the user clicks on the "Checkout" button when there are no items in the cart, an alert will pop up, notifying the user that the cart is empty.
